**A note about security**

Only guest orders may be associated, and at least 3 of the following 4 criteria must be known about the order to be associated:

- Billing Lastname
- Order Number
- Zipcode
- Email Address

The order is associated with the currently logged-in account. While more information could always be required, this is based on the Magento Sales Guest Controller and mirrors the criteria to modify/update/issue RMAs.
